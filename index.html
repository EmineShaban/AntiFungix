                    <p>Athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection that affects the skin on your feet. It is
                        caused
                        by fungi that thrive in warm and moist environments like changing rooms, showers and public
                        pools.
                        Walking barefoot in these places can put you at greater risk. Athlete’s foot usually occurs
                        between
                        your toes, but it can also affect the soles and sides of your feet.

                        <b> Good to know! </b>

                        You don’t have to be an athlete to get infected, athlete’s foot is very common. <b>Athlete’s
                            foot may
                            feel uncomfortable, but in most cases there’s nothing to worry about and it can be treated
                            easily.</b>

                        fungus, and you can treat it easily with an anti-fungal medicine applied directly onto the
                        infected area. Canesten® has a range of products available to treat your athlete’s foot.

                    <p class="q">If I ignore it, will it go away on it's own?</p>
                    <p class="a">Athlete's foot is unlikely to get better on it's own. Fortunately, it can usually
                        be easily treated with anti-fungal medicine. The earlier you treat it the sooner it will
                        clear up. For information on treating athlete’s foot simply and effectively, visit our
                        athlete’s foot condition page here.

                    <p class="q">How long does the treatment take?</p>
                    <p class="a">Depending on the product, recommended treatment time varies from 1 to 4 weeks. The
                        symptoms of the skin infection, such as itching or soreness, should improve within a few
                        days of treatment with all Canesten® athlete’s foot creams. Signs such as redness and
                        scaling may take longer to disappear. If your symptoms do not improve or worsen after using
                        an athlete’s foot treatment, please consult your doctor.

                    <p class="q">Can I continue exercising if I have athlete’s foot? </p>
                    <p class="a">Athlete’s foot shouldn’t stop you from exercising, though you should stay away from
                        swimming in order to help prevent spreading the infection. When exercising, you should wear
                        cotton socks, which are more breathable, and in changing rooms you should wear flip flops or
                        sandals. After exercising, be sure to properly clean and dry your feet, wash your socks in
                        hot water and let your shoes dry after wearing them.

                    <p class="q">How do I prevent athlete’s foot in future?</p>
                    <p class="a">There are a few simple steps you can take to lower your risk of getting athlete’s
                        foot. The most important measure you can take is to keep your feet clean and dry, especially
                        after spending time in public changing rooms, pools or showers. For more prevention tips
                        visit our athlete’s foot condition page.

                <p class="review-text">I have used this product on and off for years. Its really easy to use, you just
                    take a small amount and rub it on the affected areas, this needs to be done after washing and drying
                    your feet properly for it to be effective. You would normally use this cream for about 2 weeks to
                    make sure the athletes foot has gone. I have noticed that over the years I think the tube has got
                    small and the price has gone up. I would recommend this as a product to help if you are struggling
                    with athletes foot, it does work it just takes time.

                    itching than good. Would recommend to anyone who is suffering with athletes foot.

                    have is that the cream doesn't smell the nicest (but which cream does?) And that the cream can take
                    a while to properly sink in

                    I used this first last year for my feet as I had tried several other brands that I had hi hopes for
                    but they didn't help. I really like this stuff it's easy to apply and my feet were alot better, my
                    heels especially were suffering and between a few of my toes, I was relieved finally, the only down
                    side is it did take at least a few weeks to have an 80% improvement on my heels and around 3weeks
                    between the toes, it adds up as a little expensive because I got through 3 tubes
