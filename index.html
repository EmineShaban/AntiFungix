                    <p>Athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection that affects the skin on your feet. It is
                        caused
                        by fungi that thrive in warm and moist environments like changing rooms, showers and public
                        pools.
                        Walking barefoot in these places can put you at greater risk. Athlete’s foot usually occurs
                        between
                        your toes, but it can also affect the soles and sides of your feet.

                        <b> Good to know! </b>

                        You don’t have to be an athlete to get infected, athlete’s foot is very common. <b>Athlete’s
                            foot may
                            feel uncomfortable, but in most cases there’s nothing to worry about and it can be treated
                            easily.</b>
